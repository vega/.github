# Charter for the Vega Projects

## Scope and Goals

This is the organizational charter for [Vega](https://github.com/vega/vega), [Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite), [Vega-Altair](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair), [Vega-Embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed), [Vega-Datasets](https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets), [Vega-Themes](https://github.com/vega/vega-themes), [Vega-Tooltips](https://github.com/vega/vega-tooltip), [Vega-Editor](https://github.com/vega/editor), [VL-Convert](https://github.com/vega/vl-convert), [Altair-Tiles](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair_tiles), and [dash-vega-components](https://github.com/altair-viz/dash-vega-components). These projects are collectively referred to as the "Vega projects" in this document.

The Vega projects are in the [vega](https://github.com/vega) and [altair-viz](https://github.com/altair-viz) GitHub organizations.

## Mission

The Vega projects provide an ecosystem of tools for declarative data visualizations. The various components of this ecosystem build on each other providing different levels of abstraction.

## Steering Committee

### Purpose

The Steering Committee will be responsible for all technical oversight, project approval, policy oversight, and trademark management for the Organization.

### Composition

The Steering Committee voting members are listed in the [STEERING-COMMITTEE.md file](STEERING-COMMITTEE.md). Voting members may be added or removed by no less than 3/4 affirmative vote of the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will appoint one or two Chair(s) responsible for organizing Steering Committee activity.

## Voting

### Decision Making

The Steering Committee will strive for all decisions to be made by consensus. While explicit agreement of the entire Steering Committee is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Steering Committee will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Steering Committee and nature of support and objections. The Steering Committee will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements. If consensus cannot be reached, the Steering Committee will make the decision by a vote.

### Voting

The Steering Committee Chair will call a vote with reasonable notice to the Steering Committee, setting out a discussion period and a separate voting period. Any discussion may be conducted in person or electronically by text, voice, or video. All major decisions should be documented publicly. In any vote, each voting representative will have one vote. Decisions by vote require a simple majority vote of all voting members.

## Termination of Membership

The membership of a Steering Committee member will terminate if any of the following occur:

* **Resignation**. Written notice of resignation to the Steering Committee.

* **Unreachable Member**. If a member is unresponsive at their listed handle for more than three months the Steering Committee may vote to remove the member.

* **Code of Conduct violation**. If a member violates the Code of Conduct in a way that justifies at least a warning, the Steering Committee may vote to remove the member.

## No Confidentiality.

Information disclosed in connection with any of the Organization's activities, including but not limited to meetings, Contributions, and submissions, is not confidential, regardless of any markings or statements to the contrary.

## Project Criteria

In order to be eligible to be a Organization project, a project must:

* Be approved by the Steering Committee.
* Agree to follow the guidance and direction of the Steering Committee.
* Use only the following outbound licenses or agreements unless otherwise approved:
  - For code, a license on the Open Source Initiative's list of [Popular Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses).
