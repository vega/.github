Community health files for the Vega Projects.

The overall project charter is in [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md). The governance documents are in [GOVERNANCE.md](project-docs/GOVERNANCE.md) in the `project-docs` folder. This folder also contains the list of [admins](project-docs/ADMINS.md) and [maintainers](project-docs/MAINTAINERS.md) for the projects in the Vega organization.

## Adding Maintainers

We want many people to become maintainers. If you are asking yourself whether you should become a maintainer, the answer is probably yes. A new maintainer needs to be [proposed by an existing maintainer and voted on](project-docs/GOVERNANCE.md#maintainers).

If you as an existing maintainer want to add a new maintainer, here is a template for Slack you might use to propose adding someone.

> @channel I would like to propose to add @person as a maintainer. [write a justification]
>
> Please vote :+1: or :-1: on this message. This vote will be open for seven days after which we will decide and then delete this message.

Set yourself a reminder for seven days. 

If the vote passes, delete the Slack message, add the new person to [the list](project-docs/MAINTAINERS.md), the Slack channel, and the maintainers list of GitHub (ask any of the [Admins](project-docs/ADMINS.md) for help).
